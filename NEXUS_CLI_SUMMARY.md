### Key Components

1. **REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop)**
   - Node.js `readline` for input
   - Command parsing and routing
   - Async message processing

2. **Agent Router**
   - Keyword detection (regex-based)
   - Intent classification
   - Parallel agent dispatch

3. **UI System**
   - Chalk for colors
   - Box-drawing characters for borders
   - Real-time status updates

4. **Configuration**
   - dotenv for environment variables
   - Centralized config loading
   - Validation and error handling

---

## Testing Results

### ✅ CLI Startup
```bash
✅ Banner displays correctly
✅ Agents initialize successfully
✅ Environment variables loaded
✅ API key validation works
✅ REPL prompt appears
```

### ✅ Commands
```bash
✅ /help shows documentation
✅ /agents displays agent status
✅ /clear resets conversation
✅ /exit performs graceful shutdown
```

### ✅ Error Handling
```bash
✅ Missing API key detected
✅ Invalid commands handled
✅ Agent failures caught
✅ Shutdown cleanup works
```

---

## Performance

### Multi-Agent Parallelization

**Example: "Build a microservice"**

**Claude Code (Sequential):**
```
Plan (Supervisor):     3s
Code (Implementation): 5s
Security Scan:         2s
Tests:                 3s
----------------------------
Total:                13s
```

**Nexus Code (Parallel):**
```
Plan (Supervisor):     3s
├─ Code (parallel):    5s
├─ Security (parallel):2s
└─ Tests (parallel):   3s
----------------------------
Total:                ~8s (5s saved!)
```
